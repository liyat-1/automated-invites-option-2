/**
 * OTA Buster — domain model.
 *
 * The product concept is a guest-conversion engine, not a campaign builder:
 *   OTA booking → relationship → experience → feedback → direct booking → loyalty
 *
 * Everything here is deterministic sample data for the prototype. Where a real
 * deployment would have no data, use the `hasEnoughData` flags so the UI can
 * show honest empty / low-data states instead of inventing numbers.
